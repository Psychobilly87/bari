bari
====

Bari is an advanced build management tool for .NET projects.

The project is already usable for smaller projects, but there is no documentation available yet.

# Roadmap #

## Milestone 1 ##

* Bari will be able to compile and test itself.

## Milestone 2 ##

* Bari is able to compile one of my more complex projects with multiple _modules_ (currently as Visual Studio solutions) and custom build steps.

## Milestone 3 (release v1) ##

* Bari is tested and used by the team developing the project mentioned in Milestone 2
* Bari will be fully documented with examples and howto-s on its website


# Getting bari #

Bari itself is now compiled using bari, so you'll have to download the latest version as a binary package. 

The [latest version is 0.7](https://github.com/vigoo/bari/releases/tag/0.7).
